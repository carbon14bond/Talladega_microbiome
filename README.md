## This is a work in progress for a manuscript in preparation:

Microbial communities across a non-perennial stream continuum in an Alabama Piedmont forest.

Bioinformatics and Data analysis

This repository contains code for replicating an analysis of fungal and prokaryotic communities collected from an intermittent stream network, associated with a manuscript (Bond et al. In Preparation).

This research was conducted as part of the AIMS Project (Aquatic Intermittency effects on Microbiomes in Streams), supported by an NSF EPSCoR Track II Grant # OIA 2019603

This pipeline is composed of two main components:
- Bioinformatics / processing of amplicon sequences to prouce ASVs following the DADA2 pipeline.
- Analysis of fungal communities with environmental data. We also include code for generating maps and calculating some environmental parameters from previously published environmental datasets.

- Metadata preparation
- DECIPHER classifier training
